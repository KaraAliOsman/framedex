"""Credit notes — the only way to annul an emitted factura.

An invoice is sealed evidence: it is never updated or deleted. The
counter-document that cancels it is a nota de crédito, itself sealed
and immutable — ``payload_json`` freezes the annulled invoice's code,
the project header, the position lines, the credited totals and the
human-recorded reason at issue time.

One total credit note per invoice: ``UNIQUE(invoice_id)`` makes a
retried emission idempotent — the replay returns the already-sealed
row, never a re-render.
