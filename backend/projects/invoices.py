"""Project invoices — a sealed factura per explicit emission on the deal.

An invoice is issued by a human click against the project's latest sealed
revision: ``payload_json`` freezes the revision code, the project header,
the deal totals, the position lines, and the collected balance AT THE TIME
OF ISSUE into an immutable PDF. A project without a sealed revision has no
invoiceable deal — emission is a 409, never an invented total.

An emitted invoice is evidence: it is never updated or deleted. Correcting
a wrong emission is a credit note, a separate document type.
