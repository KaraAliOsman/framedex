-- AI-layer trust repair (hostile review AI-01 / AI-09):
-- 1) ai_audit_logs carried SELECT for every member role, so INSTALLER could
--    read the full privileged context projections the AI endpoints refuse
--    them. The select policy now mirrors _AGENT_CALLERS.
-- 2) ai_jobs was member-writable via PostgREST — a member could rewrite their
--    own job rows (state, transcript, artifacts, result). Writes now run
--    under a dedicated backend role (the API already executes inside the
--    caller's org/user policy, so the same policies apply to the role).
